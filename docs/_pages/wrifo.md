# WIFRO: Women Researchers in Fungi & Oomycetes

Women Researchers in Fungi & Oomycetes or WRIFO aims to make it easier for conference organizers and award committees to identify women in the field for conference steering committees, speakers, keynote lecturers, and award nominees. WRIFO was launched in April 2016 as an open google spreadsheet. This has been replaced by an AirTable [Gallery View](https://airtable.com/shrKdUwrRujauC2vb/tblE1K0mwGFVOjYI6) and [Grid View](https://airtable.com/shrwmp89x2TdNlZiq).

Additions can be made on [this AirTable form](https://airtable.com/shrBF2gndURXYpgKB). Direct edit of existing entries will be developed in the future or you can leave comments on the document for corrections - emailing [jasonstajich.phd-AT-gmail.com](mailto:jasonstajich.phd-AT-gmail.com) with subject "WRIFO edit" will help me track until we get commenting available. When entering a new person, there are drop down menus to select research area, geographic location, career stage and free form keywords and website URLs.

We have chosen to focus on faculty or equivalent positions only in this list. This is based on the observation that postdocs and graduate students are often well-represented as speakers picked from abstracts (contributed talks), but there has been less success supporting women in independent research positions with invitations to serve on steering committees, give talks, and award nominations.

We have stared a postdoc table as well, will work on expanding access to that information in near future.

WRIFO is aimed at improving the gender balance of speakers at conferences, [which can be achieved by having a balanced nomination committee](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mbio.01146-15), as shown by recent ASM conferences.  We also point to other efforts to promote gender and racial diversity on the conference and seminar front such as [lists hosted at Nicole Kingâ€™s labsite](http://live-king-lab.pantheon.berkeley.edu/resources-2/), [Diversify EEB](https://diversifyeeb.wordpress.com/).
