## Fungal Genome Tools

See [FungiDB](http://fungidb.org/) for new data mining tool for Fungal genomics and Fungal Genomes Tools site which will link out to more fungal genome tools.

See some archived [gene prediction parameters](https://github.com/hyphaltip/fungi-gene-prediction-params) and the [~2006-2007](http://fungalgenomes.org/data/Gene_prediction) archive as part of Augustus training of fungi parameters.
